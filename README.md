Project Overview
Stack4Us is a collaborative platform designed to help beginner programmers overcome coding blocks efficiently. Instead of relying only on AI or spending excessive time reading long documentation, Stack4Us promotes teamwork, communication, and quick learning.
Through Stack4Us, users can:
Create tickets to describe their coding problems.


Add details such as error messages, code snippets, or screenshots.


Receive help and comments from other coders and team leaders.


Filter issues by category and search faster.


Strengthen collaboration and communication skills while learning.


The project is focused on improving learning speed, problem-solving, research, and peer-to-peer communication.
