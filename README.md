# 📚 Stack4Us – SOS for Blocked Coders

## 🚀 Project Overview
Stack4Us is a collaborative platform designed to help beginner programmers overcome coding blocks efficiently. Instead of relying only on AI or spending excessive time reading long documentation, Stack4Us promotes **teamwork, communication, and quick learning**.  

Through Stack4Us, users can:  
- Create tickets to describe their coding problems.  
- Add details such as error messages, code snippets, or screenshots.  
- Receive help and comments from other coders and team leaders.  
- Filter issues by category and search faster.  
- Strengthen collaboration and communication skills while learning.  

The project is focused on improving **learning speed, problem-solving, research, and peer-to-peer communication**.
